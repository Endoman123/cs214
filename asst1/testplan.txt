Workload E:

Workload E is a workload to test the ability of mymalloc and myfree to coalese free blocks and use these coalesed blocks for reallocation.
By removing a block from the middle, coalesing blocks with in use blocks to the left and right is tested.
After freeing these blocks, the memory is reused for a single memory allocation that is the sum of the freed blocks.
This tests to see that the freed blocks were coalesed properly and can be reallocated as a single block. 


Workload F:

Workload F is a workload to stress-test a more accurate simulation of the way mymalloc and myfree are going to be used by the user.
It is often that the user will request a large block of memory at the beginning of their program for their data structures and other setup.
Then, throughout the program, free() and malloc() could be called in any number of ways depending on the program. This is simulated in the workload as random free()s and random reallocations.
Then, at the end of both the program and workload, all malloc()'d pointers are freed.
