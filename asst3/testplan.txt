   This tested the adhesion to protocol of our DUMBclient implementation   

2) Simulated hosting by using one iLab as a server and another as a client

    This tested the ability for our DUMBclient to connect to a DUMBserver,
    and for the DUMBserver to detect the connection

3) Connect to client, SIGINT server 

    This tested the client response to a forcefully stopped server

4) Connect to server, SIGINT client
