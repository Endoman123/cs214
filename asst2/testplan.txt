A) Increasing array size, constant subarray size
   This will test for the efficiency and parallelism given an increasing number of coprocesses
   processing the same number of values.

B) Constant array size, increasing subarray size
   This will test for the efficiency and parallelism given an increasing number of coprocesses
   processing smaller and smaller sub-workloads.
